          “I recently had a turbo coolant leak repaired and I was extremely
          happy with the service I received at BL Performance. Cheryl, Jonathan,
          and all the staff I interacted with were very friendly and helpful
          every step of the way. They proactively contacted my extended warranty
          provider and promptly made arrangements to do the repair. They took
          the time to clearly explain what was required, they were extremely
          thorough in making sure everything was done properly and I was updated
          throughout the process. It was a pleasure to do business with them and
          I intend to go back for any future service my truck may require. I
          highly recommend them!”

          "BL Performance, did a bunch of major repairs on my 2006 car, both
          under the hood and replacing the hybrid battery in back; then
          delivered it to me good as new. (They even cleaned up the engine
          compartment, which was an unexpected, pleasant surprise). The whole
          experience was exceptional from the 1st phone call until I got my car
          back. I give 5 stars of excellence in every possible area: Customer
          service, professionalism, technical skill, trustworthiness,
          communication and respect for me as a customer (and a big shout out to
          the Toyota tech who did the work!). They charged me extremely fair
          prices; and did not try to upsell or scare me into any repairs or
          services I didn't need. I can vouch there's a reason for all the great
          Google reviews: Because they're true! BL will be my go-to from here on
          out. Much respect and many thanks to you BL - - I highly recommended!"
